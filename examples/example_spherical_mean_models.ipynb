    "The idea of Spherical Mean models is to fit the spherical mean of a model to the spherical mean of the data, rather than fitting the separate DWIs per shell. As such, spherical mean models have no concept of orientation, dispersion or crossings. *(Kaden et al. 2015)* proposed the spherical mean technique by providing the analytic expression of the Zeppelin model. Later, *(Kaden et al. 2016)* combined the spherical mean model of a Zeppelin and Stick model to create his multi-compartment spherical mean technique.\n",

    "Taking a step forward, Dmipy allows to estimate the spherical mean representation of any Compartment Model, and combine them in a MultiCompartmentSphericalMeanModel in the same way as a standard MultiCompartmentModel. The spherical mean for a model is estimated as follows:\n",
    "- If available, the spherical mean for a model is estimated using an analytic expression (e.g. for C1Stick, G2Zeppelin and G3RestrictedZeppelin).\n",
    "- For round models such as G1Ball or restricted sphere models, the spherical mean is just a value for the given shell parameters.\n",
    "- For cylinder models without analytic expressions, we estimate the spherical mean using the its rotational_harmonics_representation. In short, the spherical mean of any spherical function (if sufficiently expanded) is equal to $c_{m=0}^{l=0} / (2 \\sqrt{\\pi})$, where $c_{m=0}^{l=0}$ is the zeroth order spherical harmonics coefficient.\n",
