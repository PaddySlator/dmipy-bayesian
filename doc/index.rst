Welcome to dmipy's documentation!
====================================

The dmipy software package facilitates state-of-the-art diffusion MRI Microstructure Imaging using a "Building Block" philosophy. In this philosophy, any combination of biophysical models, typically representing intra- and/or extra-axonal tissue compartments, can be easy combined into a multi-compartment Microstructure Model in just a few lines of code.

To see how to use it, please refer to the `README file 
<https://github.com/AthenaEPI/dmipy/blob/master/README.md>`_ in the Github repository.
